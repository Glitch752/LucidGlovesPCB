The total cost was $87.29 including batteries but excluding printed parts and the PCB as of writing.

You will also likely require:
- Solder and a soldering iron
- Dupont cables (or the connectors and a crimping kit to make your own for better cable management)
- Velcro (or an alternative way to secure the gloves)
- Foam (for comfort)
- Optionally some joysticks and buttons
- 4 short USB-C cables to attatch your batteries to the board if they don't come with some
